 Movie Search App

This is a future project I’m planning to build using **React.js**.  
It will allow users to search for movies and view their details using a public movie API like [OMDb](http://www.omdbapi.com/) or TMDb.

Status: *Learning Phase*

I’ve just started learning **React**, and this project will help me apply what I learn step-by-step.  
I'll begin development once I'm confident with the basics!
